winter can sometimes be [tough in Canada](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/12/23/ice-storm-flight-cancellations_n_4492279.html).

This winter, in Montreal, temperatures dropped down to -27.3 C (with a month average of -10.2C) and although we tested and validated our Webcampak in cold temperatures (down to -15C in France), there could always be unexpected issues when something operates that close to manufacturer's specifications.

And this 2013/2014 Winter was rude, but Webcampak successfully passed this Canadian test.

Internal heating and window defroster did a great job, we are ready for next Winter !
