So we moved to [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

You can see Jekyll as a compiler for websites, it takes some markdown files, templates, and automatically build your websites with the corresponding HTML files.

Since Jekyll does not use PHP files, it greatly reduces maintenance and potential security issues. And having built-in support with github we can host everything there.
