Pictures are captured by a Canon EOS T3I D-SLR and are automatically updated every 10 minutes.

From a technical point of view, pictures are captured in RAW and stored locally. Capture frequency will be adapted depending of the site's activity. Every 10 minutes, the latest captured picture is cropped, resized and sent to QRC West's website.

Latest picture is [available here.](http://qrcwest.com/en_view.htm)
