As soon as a probe triggers an event (over a specific limit we defined), an alert is automatically sent.

We can receive alerts 24/7 and react as soon as possible. When we receive an alert, we perform an initial diagnosis to determine the cause of the issue and get in touch with our customer with an action plan.

For increased security, all our supervision, monitoring, maintenance and configuration actions are performed through secured VPN links.
