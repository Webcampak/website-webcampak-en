Our geographical repartition is simple, our office located near Nantes (France) will take care of all requests and projects located in Europe and Asia (including Australia). Our office located in Toronto (Canada) will take care of all requests and projects located in the American continent (north or south).

Our main work languages remain French and English (website and technical documentation) but we can also answer your requests in German, Portugese or Spanish if you feel more confortable in those languages.

We also take this blog article as an opportunity to welcome Giovani onboard. With more than ten years of experiences in software and database design, Giovani will bring his extensive competences to Webcampak team in Canada.
