You can now capture and process RAW pictures captured by CANON and NIKON cameras.

The limitation being that no picture manipulation (crop, insert text, ...) would be possible. Pictures can be stored on the internal hard disk or sent to a remote FTP server (primary or secondary).

Being compatible with RAW file further increase quality of timelapse videos, but be sure to plan disk usage properly.

For example, on our dev platform equipped with a 18 Mpix DSLR camera, JPG files average at 6MB where raw files average at 22MB. It's going to use much more disk space during your project.
