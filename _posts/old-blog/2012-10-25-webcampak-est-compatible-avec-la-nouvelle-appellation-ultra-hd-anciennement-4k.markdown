Resolution will be 3840x2160 pixels, meaning capture devices will need to be at least 8.3 megapixels. First products using Ultra HD will be presented during 2013 CES.

You might have noticed that Webcampak is already compatible with such resolution and can right now generate Ultra HD timelapse videos.

Most of the time we install Canon EOS Rebel 3ti/600D inside Webcampak. Its 18 megapixels sensors is still good enough to accomodate video effects such as zoom or pan with no loss in quality.
