This new version is now easier to use, and contains the ability to draw within pictures straight from your iPad. This feature is especially interesting for construction & project managers, who can now graphically comment pictures.

Still keeping a strong focus on long-term time-lapse projects, we continuously improve the system to ease business justification of a Webcampak system. By creating key features useful before, during and after the project our solutions and services can cover a wide scope of time-lapse projects.
