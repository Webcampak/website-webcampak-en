This setup in installed in the mountains close to Denver, Colorado, US (by night you will see the city in the background).

Technically speaking, pictures are captured every 10mn by a 18 megapixels Canon EOS 600D/T3i and stored on a local NAS. Every 30mn a "thumbnail" (1280x720) is extracted and sent, over a satellite Internet connection, to our Webcampak Cloud demo server.

You might see that some pictures are missing, nothing to be worry about as everything is also stored locally. We haven't enabled multiple tries (in case of data failure) simply to spare bandwidth and to avoid too much data to be sent over the satellite link.
