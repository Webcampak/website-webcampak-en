Secured, to protect privacy of our customers and ensure that, once captured,  a picture is very unlikely to be lost.

During the next blog articles, we will give you a detailed overview of Webcampak infrastructure and provide you with examples and technical explanations.

Those articles will give you an opportunity to understand why we often insist on security and scalability and how those two components have been built into the core of our solutions.
